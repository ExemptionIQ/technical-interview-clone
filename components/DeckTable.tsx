/*
 * TODO: Create the deck table component with the following features:
 * - Integrate global state management to access the current deck of Pokemon.
 * - Accept deck data (array of Pokemon) and render rows with id, name, types, stats, and total.
 * - Provide search/filter by name or type.
 * - Support sortable columns: name, types, each stat key, and total (toggle asc/desc).
 * - Show a deck summary pill with count and average stats across the deck.
 * - Include a remove action per row to drop a Pokemon from the deck.
 * - Handle the empty state gracefully with a helpful message.
 * - Preserve styling hooks used previously (table headers, hover states, pills, summary pill).
